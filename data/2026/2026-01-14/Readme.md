# Exercise in Pregnancy

This challenge was posted already in September 2025. As not all proposed visualisations have been presented, there will be an additional webinar with this topic. Feel free to elaborate on the presented visuals or to propose new ones.

## The background

There is a recent publication:
Exercise in Pregnancy and Risk of Postpartum Depression: A Randomised Controlled Trial

The publication is available via [Wiley](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.70010).

## The challenge

In the publication the results are presented in a table and described verbally. 
Create an effective visualisation to convey the positive outcome of the trial.

## The data
The [data](../2026-01-14/patient_level_data_with_outcomes.csv) is derived to match the tabulated results in the publication. The [R code](../2026-01-14/patient_data.R) to simulate the patient level data was generated by Claude AI using model Sonnet 4.5. See the [prompt](https://claude.ai/share/718c9e21-0975-40bd-aba5-725738486643) use.
