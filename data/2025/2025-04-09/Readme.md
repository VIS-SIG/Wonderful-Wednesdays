# Macrophage Activation Syndrome

**Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)** is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition involving a massive inflammatory response that overwhelms the whole body. It mainly affects children and symptoms include: fever, tiredness, low energy, headaches, confusion, seizures, enlarged lymph nodes, liver and spleen problems and bleeding disorders.

Current standard therapy includes high dose **glucocorticoid (GC) treatment**,  although these have significant side effects including reduced growth rate, cataracts, mood changes and weight gain. Long term exposure to GC causes significant harm, especially in children.

## The data

The data provided are based on two pooled open-label studies in children (n=39) with a diagnosis of MAS disease currently receiving GC treatment. Enrolled subjects started a new investigational drug on day 1, and one objective of the study was to reduce (taper) the GC dose to a safe level during the 8 week interventional period.

The data include daily GC doses levels for the 56 day interventional period, and also weekly average GC doses (week 1-8).

| Variable Name | Variable Label                        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| SUBJID        | Subject identifier for the study      |
| ASTDY         | Analysis relative start day           |
| AVAL1         | Daily glucocorticoid dose (mg/kg/day) |
| AVISITN       | Analysis visit (N)                    |
| AVISIT        | Analysis visit                        |
| AVAL2         | Weekly average glucocorticoid dose    |

## The Challenge
* How effective was the new investigational drug in reducing GC doses over 8 weeks?
* Clinically important thresholds are 1.0, 0.5 and 0.2 mg/kg/day:
  * What proportion of subjects achieved GC doses between these levels, and how did this change over time?
  * How much variability was there in GC doses, e.g. characterise shifts between threshold levels at the individual subject level?
