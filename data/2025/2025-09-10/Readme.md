# Fatty liver disease subgroups

## The background

There is a recent publication:
The Effect of Liv.52 DS in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD): A Pilot, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Study

The publication is available via [NIH](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40765845/).

## The challenge
Create visualisation to explore possible differences in the treatment effect with regard to subgroups.

## The data
The [data](./2025-08-13/LSM_Score.csv) is derived to match the plotted results in the publication. Some baseline characteristics are simulated for the purpose of the challenge.
