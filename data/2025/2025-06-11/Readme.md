# Hyperkalemia Trial Data

## The background

The following trial was recently published:
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate versus sodium polystyrene sulfonate for treatment of hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients: a randomized clinical trial
The publication is available via [NIH](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12054224/) or [BMC Nephrology](https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-025-04129-9).

## The challenge
This months challenge is a follow-up from last month. Generate a plot that includes patient level data information or distribution information.

## The data
The patient level data was simulated by an AI generated python code. This is not real data and not the data the publication is based on. Please find the simulated data [here](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/blob/master/data/2025/2025-06-11/serum_potassium_study_data.csv).
