# Fatty liver disease subgroups - revisited

This challenge was posted already in September 2025. As not all proposed visualisations have been presented, there will be an additional webinar with this topic. Feel free to elaborate on the presented visuals or to propose new ones.

## The background

There is a recent publication:
The Effect of Liv.52 DS in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD): A Pilot, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Study

The publication is available via [NIH](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40765845/).

## The challenge
Create visualisation to explore possible differences in the treatment effect with regard to subgroups.

## The data
The [data](../2025-08-13/LSM_Score.csv) is derived to match the plotted results in the publication. Some baseline characteristics are simulated for the purpose of the challenge.
